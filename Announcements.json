  "date": "2026-01-27",
  "time": "8:46 AM EST",
  "description": " 📢 **IMPORTANT: TIKTOK LIVE & INFINITUM LIVE OFFICIAL UPDATE**\n\nCreators,\n\nWe want to provide clear, accurate updates regarding recent changes related to TikTok LIVE and important Infinitum LIVE Creator Network policies. There has been a significant amount of confusion and misinformation circulating, so please read this notice carefully.\n\nTo be absolutely clear upfront:\n\n**Infinitum LIVE Creator Network is not TikTok.**\nWe do not own TikTok, control TikTok systems, algorithms, enforcement actions, or payouts. Our role is to support creators within the rules, policies, and structure established by TikTok.\n\n---\n\n## 📱 TikTok LIVE – Current Platform Updates\n\n### 1️⃣ TikTok Ownership Update (U.S.)\nRecent announcements confirm that TikTok’s U.S. operations are now **majority U.S.-owned**, with **80.01% ownership under U.S. control**, and the remaining ownership held by ByteDance.\n\n### 2️⃣ U.S. Algorithm Retraining\nTikTok is actively retraining and restructuring the **U.S. algorithm** to improve platform compliance, safety, and long-term stability.\n\n- This does **not** remove access to global audiences\n- U.S. creators continue to interact with worldwide creators and viewers\n\n### 3️⃣ U.S. Government Ownership Rumor — False\nTikTok is **not owned by the U.S. government**. Claims suggesting direct government ownership are incorrect.\n\n### 4️⃣ Tracking & Privacy Clarification\nThere is **no forced 24/7 tracking** enabled by TikTok.\n\n- TikTok does not automatically send location data or content to any government entity\n- Location access is fully controlled by your phone’s app permissions, like any other app\n- Any law-enforcement access would require proper legal process, consistent with all major platforms\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Infinitum LIVE Creator Network – Policy Updates\n\nThe following policies are **TikTok LIVE–specific** and are **not optional**.\n\n### 5️⃣ Creator Activity Requirement (Strict Enforcement)\nAny creator who is **inactive for 3 months or longer** will be removed from the Infinitum LIVE Creator Network.\n\n- No exceptions\n- No exclusions\n- No retroactive excuses\n\nIf you have not gone LIVE in 3 months or longer, you are considered inactive. To remain in the network, you must resume going LIVE immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 💎 Diamond Incentive Program Update\n\n### 6️⃣ Temporary Pause — March 2026\nThe Infinitum LIVE Creator Network **Diamond Incentive Program (D.I.P)** will be inactive during the following period:\n\n**March 1, 2026 – March 31, 2026**\n\n- No Diamond Incentive payouts will apply during this period\n- This temporary pause is required to restructure and align with updated TikTok LIVE platform rules\n\nNew, revised Diamond Incentive pay charts will be released and will go live on **April 1, 2026**, applying going forward. Creators who have previously signed the agreement remain **automatically enrolled**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Final Notes\n\nWe understand that platform changes can create uncertainty. Our goal is to remain transparent, fully compliant, and aligned with TikTok’s evolving LIVE environment while protecting the long-term stability of both our creators and the network.\n\nIf you have questions, please contact your assigned manager or use official Infinitum LIVE communication channels.\n\nThank you for your continued effort, professionalism, and commitment.",

    "description": "📡 **TikTok LIVE Match – \"Viewers Not Matched\" Message Explained** 📡\n\nHi Creators,\n\nWe wanted to clarify a common issue some of you may encounter during TikTok LIVE Matches: the **\"Viewers Not Matched\"** message. This appears when TikTok's algorithm is unable to pair you with another host for a LIVE battle due to insufficient overlap or compatibility between your audiences.\n\n### Why This Happens:\n• **Low Viewer Engagement** – If there's minimal interaction on your stream, TikTok may not detect enough activity to create a successful match.\n• **Audience Mismatch** – Major differences in your audience's interests or behavior compared to the other host may prevent pairing.\n• **Technical Glitches** – Occasionally, the issue may stem from platform bugs or connection problems.\n\nIn most cases, this simply means your viewers were not engaging enough at the time of the match. We encourage you to keep promoting active interaction during your streams to improve match success!\n\nStay consistent, stay creative, and keep going LIVE 💎\n\n– Infinitum LIVE Creator Network",

Additionally, Infinitum will no longer schedule or promote battle-box sessions of our own.\n\n**Why this change matters**\n1. **Earnings Impact** – Battle-box revenue now diverts a larger share to the host, so you earn **significantly less** than in standard 1-to-1 battles or solo LIVE sessions.\n2. **Monthly LIVE-Time Compliance** – Minutes spent as a *guest* in someone else's box **do not count** toward Infinitum's required monthly LIVE-time thresholds. Only hours streamed from your own host window are credited.\n3. **Algorithmic Performance** – Appearing in boxes—especially when cameras are switched off—lowers viewer retention and **suppresses your reach on the For You Page**.\n4. **Brand & Viewer Experience** – Camera-off boxes hurt professionalism and viewer trust.\n\n**Infinitum's stance**\n• We **do not encourage** participation in box battles under current payout and visibility conditions.\n• We **will not** enter external battles to push scores, gifts, or rankings.\n• We **will continue** supporting your growth through coaching, strategic 1-to-1 battles, goal tracking, and high-value LIVE formats that maximize diamonds and audience retention.\n\n**Your next steps**\n• Focus on **solo or 1-to-1 battles** hosted from your own account.\n• Maintain **camera-on, high-quality streams** to drive algorithmic favorability.\n• Track your hours in InfiniVIEW to ensure they count toward monthly targets.\n• Direct questions to your Creator Network Manager or open a ticket in the \"LIVE Support\" Discord channel.",

    "description": "Hey Creators —\n\nBig news. We're launching something game-changing for our TikTok LIVE family... 🎥🔥\n\nIntroducing the Infinitum LIVE TikTok Raid Chain – a community-powered, momentum-building experience where we pass viewers from one creator to the next—just like Twitch raids, but made for us and made for TikTok.\n\n🚀 What's a TikTok Raid?\nIt's simple:\nWe go live back-to-back, each for 1 hour and 1 minute, and at the end of each session, you shout out the next creator and send your viewers their way.\n\nThis means:\n• More eyes on your content\n• More chances to go viral together\n• And a tighter, more powerful creator network ✊\n\n🧠 How It Works:\n1. You sign up for a time slot (link below).\n2. You go live on TikTok at your scheduled time.\n3. At the 60-minute mark:\n   • Shout out the next creator\n   • Pin their @handle or LIVE link in your chat\n   • Encourage your viewers to \"RAID\" over to their stream\n   • End your stream at 1 hour and 1 minute.\n\nThat's it. Your job is done, and the next creator keeps the fire going 🔥\n\n📅 Why Join the Raid Chain?\n• Grow your LIVE audience naturally\n• Get discovered by other creators' communities\n• Be part of a daily content wave that TikTok's algorithm loves\n• Support each other and show the world what creator collaboration really looks like\n\n✅ What You Need to Do Now:\n📥 Sign up here: https://forms.gle/n57LtAEJnXwbbYtv5\n🧭 Make sure your TikTok profile is set up for LIVE (must meet platform requirements)\n📢 Be ready to go live, support your fellow creators, and have fun with it!\n\n💡 Pro Tip:\nWant to stand out? Use your stream to hype up the next creator with energy, vibes, or a mini countdown before your handoff. Show the viewers it's all connected 💫\n\nLet's raid. Let's grow. Let's GO.\n\n#InfinitumLIVE #TikTokRaidChain #CreatorFamily #SupportCreators",

These actions are not only a breach of contract, but they can result in serious consequences for both the creator and the violating network.\n\n🚫 If You Leave Due to Poaching:\nThe violating agency will be reported to TikTok.\nThat agency will receive violation points, which may lead to the termination of their agency status with TikTok.\nInfinitum will pursue legal action against any individual or entity who violates our agreements or attempts to disrupt the integrity of our network.\n\n🚫 If a Creator in Our Network Starts Their Own Agency:\nThis is a breach of contract and will result in termination from Infinitum LIVE.\nIt will also trigger legal enforcement actions, including possible claims for damages, as outlined in the agreement you signed.\n\nWe do not take these matters lightly. Our contracts are legally binding, enforceable, and designed to protect the time, effort, and trust we all put into this network.\n\n🤝 Need Help or Have Questions?\nIf you're ever unsure, uncomfortable, or just need support — please reach out to your assigned manager or email us directly at support@infinitumlive.com.
