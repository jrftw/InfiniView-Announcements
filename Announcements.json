    "description": "📡 **TikTok LIVE Match – \"Viewers Not Matched\" Message Explained** 📡\n\nHi Creators,\n\nWe wanted to clarify a common issue some of you may encounter during TikTok LIVE Matches: the **\"Viewers Not Matched\"** message. This appears when TikTok's algorithm is unable to pair you with another host for a LIVE battle due to insufficient overlap or compatibility between your audiences.\n\n### Why This Happens:\n• **Low Viewer Engagement** – If there's minimal interaction on your stream, TikTok may not detect enough activity to create a successful match.\n• **Audience Mismatch** – Major differences in your audience's interests or behavior compared to the other host may prevent pairing.\n• **Technical Glitches** – Occasionally, the issue may stem from platform bugs or connection problems.\n\nIn most cases, this simply means your viewers were not engaging enough at the time of the match. We encourage you to keep promoting active interaction during your streams to improve match success!\n\nStay consistent, stay creative, and keep going LIVE 💎\n\n– Infinitum LIVE Creator Network",

    "description": "📢 **Official PSA — Policy on Box Battles & Guest Box Participation**\n\nEffective immediately, Infinitum LIVE Creator Network will **not** join or moderate any battle-box or box-battle events hosted by accounts outside our network. Additionally, Infinitum will no longer schedule or promote battle-box sessions of our own.\n\n**Why this change matters**\n1. **Earnings Impact** – Battle-box revenue now diverts a larger share to the host, so you earn **significantly less** than in standard 1-to-1 battles or solo LIVE sessions.\n2. **Monthly LIVE-Time Compliance** – Minutes spent as a *guest* in someone else's box **do not count** toward Infinitum's required monthly LIVE-time thresholds. Only hours streamed from your own host window are credited.\n3. **Algorithmic Performance** – Appearing in boxes—especially when cameras are switched off—lowers viewer retention and **suppresses your reach on the For You Page**.\n4. **Brand & Viewer Experience** – Camera-off boxes hurt professionalism and viewer trust.\n\n**Infinitum's stance**\n• We **do not encourage** participation in box battles under current payout and visibility conditions.\n• We **will not** enter external battles to push scores, gifts, or rankings.\n• We **will continue** supporting your growth through coaching, strategic 1-to-1 battles, goal tracking, and high-value LIVE formats that maximize diamonds and audience retention.\n\n**Your next steps**\n• Focus on **solo or 1-to-1 battles** hosted from your own account.\n• Maintain **camera-on, high-quality streams** to drive algorithmic favorability.\n• Track your hours in InfiniVIEW to ensure they count toward monthly targets.\n• Direct questions to your Creator Network Manager or open a ticket in the \"LIVE Support\" Discord channel.",

    "description": "Hey Creators —\n\nBig news. We're launching something game-changing for our TikTok LIVE family... 🎥🔥\n\nIntroducing the Infinitum LIVE TikTok Raid Chain – a community-powered, momentum-building experience where we pass viewers from one creator to the next—just like Twitch raids, but made for us and made for TikTok.\n\n🚀 What's a TikTok Raid?\nIt's simple:\nWe go live back-to-back, each for 1 hour and 1 minute, and at the end of each session, you shout out the next creator and send your viewers their way.\n\nThis means:\n• More eyes on your content\n• More chances to go viral together\n• And a tighter, more powerful creator network ✊\n\n🧠 How It Works:\n1. You sign up for a time slot (link below).\n2. You go live on TikTok at your scheduled time.\n3. At the 60-minute mark:\n   • Shout out the next creator\n   • Pin their @handle or LIVE link in your chat\n   • Encourage your viewers to \"RAID\" over to their stream\n   • End your stream at 1 hour and 1 minute.\n\nThat's it. Your job is done, and the next creator keeps the fire going 🔥\n\n📅 Why Join the Raid Chain?\n• Grow your LIVE audience naturally\n• Get discovered by other creators' communities\n• Be part of a daily content wave that TikTok's algorithm loves\n• Support each other and show the world what creator collaboration really looks like\n\n✅ What You Need to Do Now:\n📥 Sign up here: https://forms.gle/n57LtAEJnXwbbYtv5\n🧭 Make sure your TikTok profile is set up for LIVE (must meet platform requirements)\n📢 Be ready to go live, support your fellow creators, and have fun with it!\n\n💡 Pro Tip:\nWant to stand out? Use your stream to hype up the next creator with energy, vibes, or a mini countdown before your handoff. Show the viewers it's all connected 💫\n\nLet's raid. Let's grow. Let's GO.\n\n#InfinitumLIVE #TikTokRaidChain #CreatorFamily #SupportCreators",

Please understand:\n\n🔒 This is a direct violation of both TikTok LIVE policy and your agreement with Infinitum LIVE Creator Network.\n\n❗ Entertaining offers, conversations, or invitations from other networks while contracted with Infinitum is strictly prohibited. These actions are not only a breach of contract, but they can result in serious consequences for both the creator and the violating network.\n\n🚫 If You Leave Due to Poaching:\nThe violating agency will be reported to TikTok.\nThat agency will receive violation points, which may lead to the termination of their agency status with TikTok.\nInfinitum will pursue legal action against any individual or entity who violates our agreements or attempts to disrupt the integrity of our network.\n\n🚫 If a Creator in Our Network Starts Their Own Agency:\nThis is a breach of contract and will result in termination from Infinitum LIVE.\nIt will also trigger legal enforcement actions, including possible claims for damages, as outlined in the agreement you signed.\n\nWe do not take these matters lightly. Our contracts are legally binding, enforceable, and designed to protect the time, effort, and trust we all put into this network.\n\n🤝 Need Help or Have Questions?\nIf you're ever unsure, uncomfortable, or just need support — please reach out to your assigned manager or email us directly at support@infinitumlive.com.
